It’s Been a While
=================

</div>

<div>

This past three years has really flown. It’s time for me to finally get
back to my roots and also start blogging more, like I did previously.

</div>

<div>

My last post was about Strata 2013. During this time period, I was
taking a break from working full-time to finish a Ph.D. dissertation
that I had neglected during my previous two positions. I learned my
lesson the hard way, **never work externally if you want a Ph.D. in a
reasonable amount of time!** I quickly got my dissertation from an intro
to the first 65 pages or so during this gap. I then received an offer
from Facebook. I was ready to move to Silicon Valley and enjoy all the
things I had been envious over for so many years: the perks, the culture
of innovation and intelligence, and the technology community. This was
an opportunity I could not pass, and the dissertation went on the
back-burner for another two years as I spent the majority of my waking
hours, both during the week and the weekend… and on holidays… coding
into a frenzy. I was looking forward to living in a world where I was
entrenched in the technology and data ecosystem. But…

</div>

#### The Grass Isn’t Greener on the Other Side

</div>

<div>

![](http://www.bytemining.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cattle_eating_grass_through_barbed_wire_fence2.jpg)The
technology community is definitely there and is obviously very strong,
but it isn’t what I thought it would be. Due to the sheer size of the
industry, meetups and other events were very impersonal compared to what
I was used to in the LA area. Additionally, it seems that most of that
original Silicon Valley startup energy has moved to San Francisco. To
get to meetups, I would spend hours on shuttles, Caltrain, BART and Muni
getting to SoMa and then being disappointed at the frequent company
pitches instead of discussing actual science and technology. Not all
groups are like that, as I attended plenty of meetups that were
technical and whetted my appetite to learn more. Of course, there was
also the question if I could even get *into* the meetup. The majority of
the meetup groups I was a part of would fill up in a few hours for a hot
topic or engaging speaker with waiting lists sometimes 100 to 200 people
long. The final blow was that my attendance assumed I could get away
from my projects at work, which I really could not. My technology
community ended up being the others at the company, which may have been
helpful for my job, but gave me a narrower focus than I wanted, and was
just one more thing that kept me at work. Meetups are not the only
important thing in the technology community though. I did attend a few
conferences such as [ACM SIGCIKM](http://www.cikm2013.org/),
[BayLearn](https://www.facebook.com/academics/posts/591070350944376),
[Strata 2014](http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata2014) (but for
recruiting), and I spoke at [PyData when it was held at
Facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ZTKFZ-1QQ). To be fully
immersed in the technology community and experience, it seems one now
needs to live in San Francisco, and San Francisco is definitely not the
city for me — I am more of a Silicon Valley suburb type but the energy
wasn’t the same.

</div>

<div>

I am not alone when I say that I spent most of my waking life working.
Since I had moved there for a job, and I didn’t have any roots, friends
or family in the area I thought it would make sense for me to do this.
But, working at this rate took a toll on me physically, mentally and
emotionally. Although there is a lot to do in the Bay Area, there really
wasn’t any time to do it because of the work culture. And people didn’t
seem to have time for me for the same reason. This is not true for
everyone, but I found it much more true in the Bay Area than anywhere
else I have lived. To add to the long work hours, this is not the first
time I have been an “overachiever” in life — this is something I had
been afflicted with since high school (the 90s).

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

Not only is there stress from long hours and a lack of any outside
world, [the Bay Area is extremely
expensive](http://www.sfgate.com/business/networth/article/Tech-wages-rents-still-soaring-in-Bay-Area-6671315.php)
— nobody argues against this point. My 850 square foot one-bedroom
apartment in Mountain View is now on the market for \$4200/month.
[Buying a
house](http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/04/04/zillow-55-of-bay-area-homes-not-affordable-prices-rising-beyond-historic-highs/)
is typically not practical for new and mid-career engineers unless they
have been at a large company for a while, or had a big payout from a
startup, or were willing to have a longer commute from outside of the
valley. A small one-bedroom house can easily list at over one-million
dollars in Mountain View and Palo Alto. Next, there are going to be *n*
other bidders that also want the same house. It is incredibly common for
already ridiculously overpriced houses in Palo Alto to sell for a lot
more than the listing price. If you are single, you are going to need
that tax writeoff, or you are in for a huge surprise at tax time. This
lifestyle is not sustainable in the long run. And for me, it was an
issue that does not make me miss the area much.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

On the other hand, many parts of the Bay Area are absolutely beautiful.
From the green forests above Santa Cruz, to the pristine coastline from
Monterey north, the green rolling hills in San Jose and the East Bay, to
the bizarre other-worldly marshes along the bay. It was a dry two years
so the weather was not all that different from LA.

</div>

<div>

I learned a valuable lesson. *It’s true that the grass isn’t greener on
the other side*. You can shower a person with free meals, free rides and
other perks (I even forget what they were… they ended up not being
important), but all it does is keep you at work, and keep you engaged
with only that one part of your life. Your “friends” end up being at the
company and ends up being a bad thing in such a competitive environment.
Other perks like an onsite doctor, dentist and physical therapist may
sound nice, but they were not up to par with services I received
elsewhere, and again are just ways to keep you at work. These things are
gimmicks. They are good to entice people, they are good to make life
convenient, but they really are just ways to keep you at work and pay
you less.

</div>

<div>

#### Burn Out: Time to Reflect and Slow Down

</div>

<div>

![](http://www.bytemining.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/385px-California_1.svg_.png)When
I returned to LA, I drove down Pacific Coast Highway and looked out to
the ocean. As the orange winter sun beat on my face through the window,
I could not believe it had been 2 years since I had taken that drive.
That was not like me. I lived for the beach atmosphere and the sense of
unwinding it provided me. At that moment, <span
class="author-d-16z86ztz122z98z81zz82zz85zunv3z82zpqfnl6em2z70z9wr44z76zz79zz76zz83zirz88z6koz82z5z87zz83zz83zz83zz87zz81z">I
realized that I wanted to slow down my “nerves” — not only back to my
original levels, but even slower. I wanted to take time out for myself,
not only to finish my research, but also to enjoy life, and think about
what makes me happy both as a person and as a professional. I realized
that in that two years, I lost myself and with each lonely day, I lost
my passion for my interests and I did not have many hobbies other than
working.</span>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

For the past ten years, I’ve spent time in the Eastern Sierra but not
nearly enough. I was finally able to buy a vacation home in
[Mammoth](http://www.visitmammoth.com) and now have the time to enjoy
it. I have spent the past several months hiking, mountain biking,
snowshoeing and taking drives through some of nature’s finest beauty.
The solitude and intrigue of the wilderness is very cleansing and good
for the soul. I’ve also lost quite a bit of weight since leaving behind
the free meals and becoming so active. I had always been a brisk walker,
and always preferred to use my legs rather than my wheels, but this was
the first time since college I did vigorous heart-pumping activity on a
routine basis. When I look back, I realize it was not just the past
three years that have burned me out. It’s the entire way I have been
living my adulthood. 

</div>

<div>

#### Things Have Changed

</div>

<div>

I am not closing any doors in this post, but I have learned to value a
sane work environment and work hours over perks and pure compensation.
Rather than focus on compensation and working at a “hot” company, my
intention is to do work that benefits the common good with respect to my
interests, while providing me with the means to live, retire, and *have
funds available for my own hobbies and side projects.* There is only one
thing that I will not compromise on (ok, two): I must be able to wear
shorts, and I must be able to have flexible hours. Whether or not to
accept a position is now a lot more complex than looking at a company’s
base product and having coding, machine learning and statistics in the
job requirements/description. I do not want spend 1% of my time doing
machine learning using some basic model (i.e. Naive Bayes or Logistic
Regression) and the other 99% scaling it to billions of observations.
Rather, I would like to be able to explore more on the machine learning
side, and learn new algorithms and methods for prediction and
classification. This does not mean that I *completely *want to move away
from the systems engineering stuff, but it will really depend on the
*product *and the *team *rather than just the *company*.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

For the time being, I am consulting and also mentoring a startup. I may
continue to do that as my career, I may not. I have several ideas for
startups that I may pursue, but I may not. Who knows, maybe I will
return to the Bay Area (under the constraints I mentioned earlier), or I
may not. I will probably return to being more active in the community
like I used to be, but I have realized that there is a lot of noise,
hype and ego in the blogosphere, Twittersphere, and these thousands of
dollars conferences. There is something to be said by just doing my own
thing. Maybe I have just grown as a professional, I don’t know. I just
know that these things should be taken with a grain of salt.

</div>

<div>

#### Switching Fields?

</div>

<div>

After a lot of introspection, I want to take a look at some other fields
outside of “pure tech” including but not limited to:

</div>

<div>

-   **Environmental and activity geospatial data. **After living in the
    mountains, I’ve become very interested in environmental data,
    particularly using time series, GPS telemetry and
    geospatial analysis. My interest in this field has applications from
    everything from efficient placement of snowmobiles for SAR
    operations, to action sports and activity intelligence,
    even navigation.
-   **Finance.** Finance used to be on my list of “never
    ever.”** **After learning more about economics and Wall Street from
    my time in startups and Silicon Valley, I am also interested in some
    applications in finance. Machine learning is obviously very useful
    for automated investing, but data visualization has proven to be
    useful in manual transactions for me.
-   **Education.** My original draw to statistics was the field of
    psychometrics and the develop of educational assessments. I am
    considering going back in this direction. I am also interested in
    the educational technology sector improving the delivery of
    educational materials and assessment of learning. Of course, I may
    go into teaching altogether, most likely at the college level, or as
    some type of training consultant.
-   **Aviation: Airliners and drones.** People that know me well know
    that I love airports, airlines and flying. Aviation uses a lot of
    different data science techniques. Drones are an emerging technology
    and routing drones in the sky has become a challenge that companies
    are working on. Routing, both for drones and airliners, uses
    geospatial/map data and network/graph data and takes into account
    many variables that affect flight, airspace congestion, and
    airport/ground resource usage. Wait time and queuing theory is also
    very important for runway operations. There is a lot of game theory,
    network analysis, and other data science involved in pricing and
    scheduling of airliner flights. All of these challenges are
    interesting to me.
-   **“Internet of Things.”** It annoys me that the emerging field of
    embedded systems, their development and data processing has become
    yet another cheap buzzword like “big data” or the misuse of the term
    “data science.” Devices such as the Raspberry Pi, Arduino and custom
    printed circuit boards allow the masses to create new data
    collection devices that unobtrusively fit anywhere data
    need recording. While the data itself is interesting, in this one
    particular case, I am actually more interested in the hardware, and
    pure engineering side rather than the data science side.
-   **Security** is an exponentially growing field that has become
    pivotal not only for national security, but for privacy. Security is
    a field that is very interesting to me, but one I know very little
    about, and thus is an option for a more ambitious change of field. I
    can see it being a field I would be passionate about the more I
    learn about it. Security would be unchartered waters for me, but I
    do not see it as a field that will be disappearing anytime soon.

After typing up this list and re-reading it, I realize I still have the
same level of passion I always did, and perhaps my soul needed to focus
on something else for a while. Now I just have to make the choices of
which ones are the most rewarding, and which ones provide the best
opportunities for me. In any job interview, there is always the “Do you
have any questions for me/us?” Over the past several years, I have
compiled a long list of questions. And if I do not like the answer, or
if I can tell the interviewer is BSing the answer, abort! Perks and big
names are not the key to happiness or a more fulfilled life — becoming a
better person and being able to enjoy the process of life is.

Below are some pictures from my neighborhood!
