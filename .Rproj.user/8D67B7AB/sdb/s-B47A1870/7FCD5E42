It’s time for me to finally get\nback to my roots and also start blogging more, like I did previously.\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\nMy last post was about Strata 2013. During this time period, I was\ntaking a break from working full-time to finish a Ph.D. dissertation\nthat I had neglected during my previous two positions. I learned my\nlesson the hard way, **never work externally if you want a Ph.D. in a\nreasonable amount of time!** I quickly got my dissertation from an intro\nto the first 65 pages or so during this gap. I then received an offer\nfrom Facebook. I was ready to move to Silicon Valley and enjoy all the\nthings I had been envious over for so many years: the perks, the culture\nof innovation and intelligence, and the technology community. This was\nan opportunity I could not pass, and the dissertation went on the\nback-burner for another two years as I spent the majority of my waking\nhours, both during the week and the weekend… and on holidays… coding\ninto a frenzy. I was looking forward to living in a world where I was\nentrenched in the technology and data ecosystem. But…\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n#### The Grass Isn’t Greener on the Other Side\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n![](http://www.bytemining.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cattle_eating_grass_through_barbed_wire_fence2.jpg)The\ntechnology community is definitely there and is obviously very strong,\nbut it isn’t what I thought it would be. Due to the sheer size of the\nindustry, meetups and other events were very impersonal compared to what\nI was used to in the LA area. Additionally, it seems that most of that\noriginal Silicon Valley startup energy has moved to San Francisco. To\nget to meetups, I would spend hours on shuttles, Caltrain, BART and Muni\ngetting to SoMa and then being disappointed at the frequent company\npitches instead of discussing actual science and technology. Not all\ngroups are like that, as I attended plenty of meetups that were\ntechnical and whetted my appetite to learn more. Of course, there was\nalso the question if I could even get *into* the meetup. The majority of\nthe meetup groups I was a part of would fill up in a few hours for a hot\ntopic or engaging speaker with waiting lists sometimes 100 to 200 people\nlong. The final blow was that my attendance assumed I could get away\nfrom my projects at work, which I really could not. My technology\ncommunity ended up being the others at the company, which may have been\nhelpful for my job, but gave me a narrower focus than I wanted, and was\njust one more thing that kept me at work. Meetups are not the only\nimportant thing in the technology community though. I did attend a few\nconferences such as [ACM SIGCIKM](http://www.cikm2013.org/),\n[BayLearn](https://www.facebook.com/academics/posts/591070350944376),\n[Strata 2014](http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata2014) (but for\nrecruiting), and I spoke at [PyData when it was held at\nFacebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ZTKFZ-1QQ). To be fully\nimmersed in the technology community and experience, it seems one now\nneeds to live in San Francisco, and San Francisco is definitely not the\ncity for me — I am more of a Silicon Valley suburb type but the energy\nwasn’t the same.\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\nI am not alone when I say that I spent most of my waking life working.\nSince I had moved there for a job, and I didn’t have any roots, friends\nor family in the area I thought it would make sense for me to do this.\nBut, working at this rate took a toll on me physically, mentally and\nemotionally. Although there is a lot to do in the Bay Area, there really\nwasn’t any time to do it because of the work culture. And people didn’t\nseem to have time for me for the same reason. This is not true for\neveryone, but I found it much more true in the Bay Area than anywhere\nelse I have lived. To add to the long work hours, this is not the first\ntime I have been an “overachiever” in life — this is something I had\nbeen afflicted with since high school (the 90s).\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\nNot only is there stress from long hours and a lack of any outside\nworld, [the Bay Area is extremely\nexpensive](http://www.sfgate.com/business/networth/article/Tech-wages-rents-still-soaring-in-Bay-Area-6671315.php)\n— nobody argues against this point. My 850 square foot one-bedroom\napartment in Mountain View is now on the market for \\$4200/month.\n[Buying a\nhouse](http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/04/04/zillow-55-of-bay-area-homes-not-affordable-prices-rising-beyond-historic-highs/)\nis typically not practical for new and mid-career engineers unless they\nhave been at a large company for a while, or had a big payout from a\nstartup, or were willing to have a longer commute from outside of the\nvalley. A small one-bedroom house can easily list at over one-million\ndollars in Mountain View and Palo Alto. Next, there are going to be *n*\nother bidders that also want the same house. It is incredibly common for\nalready ridiculously overpriced houses in Palo Alto to sell for a lot\nmore than the listing price. If you are single, you are going to need\nthat tax writeoff, or you are in for a huge surprise at tax time. This\nlifestyle is not sustainable in the long run. And for me, it was an\nissue that does not make me miss the area much.\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\nOn the other hand, many parts of the Bay Area are absolutely beautiful.\nFrom the green forests above Santa Cruz, to the pristine coastline from\nMonterey north, the green rolling hills in San Jose and the East Bay, to\nthe bizarre other-worldly marshes along the bay. It was a dry two years\nso the weather was not all that different from LA.\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\nI learned a valuable lesson. *It’s true that the grass isn’t greener on\nthe other side*. You can shower a person with free meals, free rides and\nother perks (I even forget what they were… they ended up not being\nimportant), but all it does is keep you at work, and keep you engaged\nwith only that one part of your life. Your “friends” end up being at the\ncompany and ends up being a bad thing in such a competitive environment.\nOther perks like an onsite doctor, dentist and physical therapist may\nsound nice, but they were not up to par with services I received\nelsewhere, and again are just ways to keep you at work. These things are\ngimmicks. They are good to entice people, they are good to make life\nconvenient, but they really are just ways to keep you at work and pay\nyou less.\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n#### Burn Out: Time to Reflect and Slow Down\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n![](http://www.bytemining.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/385px-California_1.svg_.png)When\nI returned to LA, I drove down Pacific Coast Highway and looked out to\nthe ocean. As the orange winter sun beat on my face through the window,\nI could not believe it had been 2 years since I had taken that drive.\nThat was not like me. I lived for the beach atmosphere and the sense of\nunwinding it provided me. At that moment, <span\nclass=\"author-d-16z86ztz122z98z81zz82zz85zunv3z82zpqfnl6em2z70z9wr44z76zz79zz76zz83zirz88z6koz82z5z87zz83zz83zz83zz87zz81z\">I\nrealized that I wanted to slow down my “nerves” — not only back to my\noriginal levels, but even slower. I wanted to take time out for myself,\nnot only to finish my research, but also to enjoy life, and think about\nwhat makes me happy both as a person and as a professional. I realized\nthat in that two years, I lost myself and with each lonely day, I lost\nmy passion for my interests and I did not have many hobbies other than\nworking.</span>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\nFor the past ten years, I’ve spent time in the Eastern Sierra but not\nnearly enough. I was finally able to buy a vacation home in\n[Mammoth](http://www.visitmammoth.com) and now have the time to enjoy\nit. I have spent the past several months hiking, mountain biking,\nsnowshoeing and taking drives through some of nature’s finest beauty.\nThe solitude and intrigue of the wilderness is very cleansing and good\nfor the soul. I’ve also lost quite a bit of weight since leaving behind\nthe free meals and becoming so active. I had always been a brisk walker,\nand always preferred to use my legs rather than my wheels, but this was\nthe first time since college I did vigorous heart-pumping activity on a\nroutine basis. When I look back, I realize it was not just the past\nthree years that have burned me out. It’s the entire way I have been\nliving my adulthood. \n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n#### Things Have Changed\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\nI am not closing any doors in this post, but I have learned to value a\nsane work environment and work hours over perks and pure compensation.\nRather than focus on compensation and working at a “hot” company, my\nintention is to do work that benefits the common good with respect to my\ninterests, while providing me with the means to live, retire, and *have\nfunds available for my own hobbies and side projects.* There is only one\nthing that I will not compromise on (ok, two): I must be able to wear\nshorts, and I must be able to have flexible hours. Whether or not to\naccept a position is now a lot more complex than looking at a company’s\nbase product and having coding, machine learning and statistics in the\njob requirements/description. I do not want spend 1% of my time doing\nmachine learning using some basic model (i.e. Naive Bayes or Logistic\nRegression) and the other 99% scaling it to billions of observations.\nRather, I would like to be able to explore more on the machine learning\nside, and learn new algorithms and methods for prediction and\nclassification. This does not mean that I *completely *want to move away\nfrom the systems engineering stuff, but it will really depend on the\n*product *and the *team *rather than just the *company*.\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\nFor the time being, I am consulting and also mentoring a startup. I may\ncontinue to do that as my career, I may not. I have several ideas for\nstartups that I may pursue, but I may not. Who knows, maybe I will\nreturn to the Bay Area (under the constraints I mentioned earlier), or I\nmay not. I will probably return to being more active in the community\nlike I used to be, but I have realized that there is a lot of noise,\nhype and ego in the blogosphere, Twittersphere, and these thousands of\ndollars conferences. There is something to be said by just doing my own\nthing. Maybe I have just grown as a professional, I don’t know. I just\nknow that these things should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n#### Switching Fields?\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\nAfter a lot of introspection, I want to take a look at some other fields\noutside of “pure tech” including but not limited to:\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n-   **Environmental and activity geospatial data. **After living in the\n    mountains, I’ve become very interested in environmental data,\n    particularly using time series, GPS telemetry and\n    geospatial analysis. My interest in this field has applications from\n    everything from efficient placement of snowmobiles for SAR\n    operations, to action sports and activity intelligence,\n    even navigation.\n-   **Finance.** Finance used to be on my list of “never\n    ever.”** **After learning more about economics and Wall Street from\n    my time in startups and Silicon Valley, I am also interested in some\n    applications in finance. Machine learning is obviously very useful\n    for automated investing, but data visualization has proven to be\n    useful in manual transactions for me.\n-   **Education.** My original draw to statistics was the field of\n    psychometrics and the develop of educational assessments. I am\n    considering going back in this direction. I am also interested in\n    the educational technology sector improving the delivery of\n    educational materials and assessment of learning. Of course, I may\n    go into teaching altogether, most likely at the college level, or as\n    some type of training consultant.\n-   **Aviation: Airliners and drones.** People that know me well know\n    that I love airports, airlines and flying. Aviation uses a lot of\n    different data science techniques. Drones are an emerging technology\n    and routing drones in the sky has become a challenge that companies\n    are working on. Routing, both for drones and airliners, uses\n    geospatial/map data and network/graph data and takes into account\n    many variables that affect flight, airspace congestion, and\n    airport/ground resource usage. Wait time and queuing theory is also\n    very important for runway operations. There is a lot of game theory,\n    network analysis, and other data science involved in pricing and\n    scheduling of airliner flights. All of these challenges are\n    interesting to me.\n-   **“Internet of Things.”** It annoys me that the emerging field of\n    embedded systems, their development and data processing has become\n    yet another cheap buzzword like “big data” or the misuse of the term\n    “data science.” Devices such as the Raspberry Pi, Arduino and custom\n    printed circuit boards allow the masses to create new data\n    collection devices that unobtrusively fit anywhere data\n    need recording. While the data itself is interesting, in this one\n    particular case, I am actually more interested in the hardware, and\n    pure engineering side rather than the data science side.\n-   **Security** is an exponentially growing field that has become\n    pivotal not only for national security, but for privacy. Security is\n    a field that is very interesting to me, but one I know very little\n    about, and thus is an option for a more ambitious change of field. I\n    can see it being a field I would be passionate about the more I\n    learn about it. Security would be unchartered waters for me, but I\n    do not see it as a field that will be disappearing anytime soon.\n\nAfter typing up this list and re-reading it, I realize I still have the\nsame level of passion I always did, and perhaps my soul needed to focus\non something else for a while. Now I just have to make the choices of\nwhich ones are the most rewarding, and which ones provide the best\nopportunities for me. In any job interview, there is always the “Do you\nhave any questions for me/us?” Over the past several years, I have\ncompiled a long list of questions. And if I do not like the answer, or\nif I can tell the interviewer is BSing the answer, abort! Perks and big\nnames are not the key to happiness or a more fulfilled life — becoming a\nbetter person and being able to enjoy the process of life is.\n\nBelow are some pictures from my
