It\nwas one of the tougher ones: an intense teaching experience, attempts to\nratchet up research, and parenting a baby that’s still too young to\nentertain itself but old enough to get into trouble.\n\nPrevious posts: the\n[1st](http://civilstat.com/2014/02/after-1st-semester-of-statistics-phd-program/),\n[2nd](http://civilstat.com/2014/05/after-2nd-semester-of-statistics-phd-program/),\n[3rd](http://civilstat.com/2014/12/after-3rd-semester-of-statistics-phd-program/),\nand\n[4th](http://civilstat.com/2015/06/after-4th-semester-of-statistics-phd-program/)\nsemesters of my Statistics PhD program.\n\nClasses\n=======\n\nI’m past all the required coursework, so I only audited **Topics in High\nDimensional Statistics**, taught by [Alessandro\nRinaldo](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~arinaldo/) as a pair of half-semester\ncourses ([36-788](http://stat.cmu.edu/~arinaldo/36788/) and\n[36-789](http://stat.cmu.edu/~arinaldo/36789/)). “High-dimensional” here\nloosely means problems where you have more variables (p) than\nobservations (n). For instance, in genetic or neuroscience datasets, you\nmight have thousands of measurements each from only tens of patients.\nThe theory here is different than in traditional statistics because you\nusually assume that p grows with n, so that getting more observations\nwon’t reduce the problem to a traditional one.\n\nThis course focused on some of the theoretical tools (like concentration\ninequalities) and results (like minimax bounds) that are especially\nuseful for studying properties of high-dimensional methods. Ale did a\ngreat job covering useful techniques and connecting the material from\nlecture to lecture.\n\nIn the final part of the course, students presented recent\nminimax-theory papers. It was useful to see my fellow students work\nthrough how these techniques are used in practice, as well as to get\npractice giving “chalk talks” without projected slides. I gave a talk\ntoo, preparing jointly with my classmate [Lingxue\nZhu](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/people/students/lzhu1) (who is very\nknowledgeable, sharp, and always great to work with!) Ale’s feedback on\nmy talk was that it was “very linear”—I hope that was a good thing? Easy\nto follow?\n\nAlso, as in every other stats class I’ve had here, we brought up [the\ncurse of\ndimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)—meaning\nthat, in high-dimensional data, very few points are likely to be near\nthe joint mean. I saw a great practical example of this in a story about\n[the US Air Force’s troubles designing fighter planes for the “average”\npilot](http://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2016/01/16/when-us-air-force-discovered-the-flaw-of-averages.html).\n\nTeaching\n========\n\nI taught a data visualization course! Check out [my course materials\nhere](http://civilstat.com/2015/10/statistical-graphics-and-visualization-course-materials/).\nThere’ll be a separate post reflecting on the whole experience. But the\nsummer before, it was fun (and helpful) to binge-read all those dataviz\nbooks I’ve always meant to read.\n\nI’ve been able to repurpose my lecture materials for a few short talks\ntoo. I was invited to present a one-lecture intro to data viz for [Seth\nWiener](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/swiener/)‘s linguistics students\nhere at CMU, as well as for a seminar on Data Dashboard Design run by\n[Matthew Ritter](http://www.olin.edu/faculty/profile/matthew-ritter/) at\nmy alma mater (Olin College). I also gave an intro to the Grammar of\nGraphics (the broader concept behind `ggplot2`) for our [Pittsburgh useR\nGroup](http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-useR-Group/events/227171102/).\n\nResearch\n========\n\nI’m officially working with [Jing\nLei](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~jinglei/), still looking at sparse PCA but\nalso some other possible thesis topics. Jing is a great instructor,\nresearcher, and collaborator working on many fascinating problems. (I\nalso appreciate that he, too, has a young child and is understanding\nabout the challenges of parenting.)\n\nBut I’m afraid I made very slow research progress this fall. A lot of my\ntime went towards teaching the dataviz course, and plenty went to\nparenthood (see below), both of which will be reduced in the spring\nsemester. I also wish I had some grad-student collaborators. I’m not\npart of a larger research group right now, so meetings are just between\nmy advisor and me. Meetings with Jing are very productive, but in\nbetween it’d also be nice to hash out tough ideas together with a fellow\nstudent, without taking up an advisor’s time or stumbling around on my\nown.\n\nThough it’s not quite the same, I started attending the [Statistical\nMachine Learning Reading Group](http://statml.cs.cmu.edu/) regularly.\nFollowing these talks is another good way to stretch my math muscles and\nkeep up with recent literature.\n\nLife\n====\n\nAs a nice break from statistics, we got to see our friends [Bryan\nWright](http://www.bryanswright.com/wpdir/) and [Yuko\nEguchi](http://www.yukoeguchi.com/yuko/Home.html) both defend their PhD\ndissertations in musicology. A defense in the humanities seems to be\nmuch more of a conversation involving the whole committee, vs. the\nlecture given by Statistics folks defending PhDs.\n\nBesides home and school, I’ve been a well-intentioned but ineffective\nvolunteer, trying to manage a few pro bono statistical projects. It\nturns out that virtual collaboration, managing a far-flung team of\npeople who’ve never met face-to-face, is a serious challenge. I’ve tried\nreading up on advice but haven’t found any great tips—so please leave a\ncomment if you know any good resources.\n\nSo far, I’ve learned that choosing the right volunteer team is\nimportant. Apparent *enthusiasm* (I’m eager to have a new project! or\neven eager for this particular project!) doesn’t seem to predict\ncommitment or followup as well as apparent *professionalism* (whether or\nnot I’m eager, I will stay organized and get s\\*\\*t done).\n\nMeanwhile, the baby is no longer in the “potted-plant stage” (when you\ncan put him down and expect he’ll still be there a second later), but\nnot yet in day care, while my wife is returning to part-time work. After\nthis semester, we finally got off the wait-lists and into day care, but\nmeanwhile it was much harder to juggle home and school commitments this\nsemester.\n\nHowever, he’s an amazing little guy, and it’s fun finally taking him to\noutings and playdates at the park and zoo and museums (where he stares\nat the floor instead of exhibits… except for the [model\nrailroad](http://www.carnegiesciencecenter.org/exhibits/miniature-railroad/),\nwhich he really loved!) We also finally made it out to\n[Kennywood](https://www.kennywood.com/), a gorgeous local amusement\npark, for their holiday light show.\n\nHere’s to more exploration of Pittsburgh as the little guy keeps\ngrowing!\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"entry-info\">\n\nThis entry was posted in\n[Education](http://civilstat.com/category/education/),\n[Statistics](http://civilstat.com/category/statistics/).
