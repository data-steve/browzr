(I am also aware of the backlash related to use\nof the word “storytelling” in regards to scientific analysis, although I\nam less concerned about this than, say, [these\nscholars](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n11/full/nmeth.2699.html).)\nAs a teacher of data analysis, the use of narrative is especially\npoignant in that it ties the analyses performed intrinsically to the\ndata context—or at the very least, to a logical flow of methods used.\n\nI recently read an article posted on *Brain Pickings* about the\n[psychology behind great\nstories](https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/01/20/jerome-bruner-actual-minds-possible-worlds-storytelling/).\nIn the article, the author, Maria Popova,  cites Jerome Bruner’s (a\npioneer of cognitive psychology) essay “Two Modes of Thought”:\n\n> There are two modes of cognitive functioning, two modes of thought,\n> each providing distinctive ways of ordering experience, of\n> constructing reality. The two (though complementary) are irreducible\n> to one another. Efforts to reduce one mode to the other or to ignore\n> one at the expense of the other inevitably fail to capture the rich\n> diversity of thought.\n>\n> Each of the ways of knowing, moreover, has operating principles of its\n> own and its own criteria of well-formedness. They differ radically in\n> their procedures for verification. A good story and a well-formed\n> argument are different natural kinds. Both can be used as means for\n> convincing another. Yet what they convince *of* is fundamentally\n> different: arguments convince one of their truth, stories of their\n> lifelikeness. The one verifies by eventual appeal to procedures for\n> establishing formal and empirical proof. The other establishes not\n> truth but verisimilitude.\n\nThe essence of his essay is that, as Popova states, “a story (allegedly\ntrue or allegedly fictional) is judged for its goodness as a story by\ncriteria **that are of a different kind** from those used to judge a\nlogical argument as adequate or correct.” \\[highlighting is mine\\]\n\nWhat type of implications does this have on a data narrative, where, in\nprinciple, both criteria are being judged? Does one outweigh the other\nin a reader’s judgment? How does this affect reviewers when they are\nmaking decisions about publication?\n\nMy sense is that psychologically, the judgment of two differing sets of\ncriteria will lead most humans to judge one as being more salient than\nthe other. Presumably, most scientists would want the logical argument\n(or as Brunner calls it, the logico-scientific argument) to prevail in\nthis case. However, I think it is the story that most readers, even\nthose with scientific backgrounds, will tend to remember.\n\nAs for reviewers, again, the presumption is that they will evaluate a\npaper’s merit on its scientific evidence. But, as any reviewer can tell\nyou, the writing and narrative presenting that evidence is in some ways\nas important for that evidence to be believable. This is why great\ncourtroom attorneys  spend just as much time on developing the story\naround a case as marshaling a logical argument they will use to entice a\njury.\n\nThere is little guidance for statisticians, especially nascent\nstatisticians, about what the “right” degree of paradigmatic and\nlogico-scientific argument should be when writing up data analysis. In\nfact, many of us (including myself) do not often consider the impact of\na reader’s weighing of these different types of evidence. My training in\ngraduate school was more focused on the latter type of writing, and it\nwas only in undergraduate writing courses and through reading other\nauthors’ thoughts about writing that the former is even relevant to me.\nUltimately there may be not much to do about how reader’s perceive our\nwork. Perhaps it is as Sylvia Plath [wrote about\npoetry](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/07/03/sylvia-plath-letters-home-first-tragic-poem/),\nonce a poem is made available to the public, the right of interpretation\nbelongs to the reader.”\n\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\">\n\n<div\nclass=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\">\n\n### Share this: {.sd-title}\n\n<div class=\"sd-content\">\n\n-   [<span>Twitter</span>](http://citizen-statistician.org/2016/02/02/how-do-readers-perceive-the-results-of-a-data-analysis/?share=twitter \"Click to share on Twitter\")\n-   [<span>Facebook</span>](http://citizen-statistician.org/2016/02/02/how-do-readers-perceive-the-results-of-a-data-analysis/?share=facebook \"Click to share on Facebook\")\n-   [<span>Google</span>](http://citizen-statistician.org/2016/02/02/how-do-readers-perceive-the-results-of-a-data-analysis/?share=google-plus-1 \"Click to share on Google+\")\n-   [<span>Reddit</span>](http://citizen-statistician.org/2016/02/02/how-do-readers-perceive-the-results-of-a-data-analysis/?share=reddit \"Click to share on Reddit\")\n-   [<span>LinkedIn</span>](http://citizen-statistician.org/2016/02/02/how-do-readers-perceive-the-results-of-a-data-analysis/?share=linkedin \"Click to share on LinkedIn\")\n-   [<span>Pinterest</span>](http://citizen-statistician.org/2016/02/02/how-do-readers-perceive-the-results-of-a-data-analysis/?share=pinterest \"Click to share on Pinterest\")\n-   [<span>More</span>](#)\n-   \n\n<div class=\"sharing-hidden\">\n\n<div class=\"inner\" style=\"display: none;\">\n\n-   [<span>Email</span>](http://citizen-statistician.org/2016/02/02/how-do-readers-perceive-the-results-of-a-data-analysis/?share=email \"Click to email this to a friend\")\n-   [<span>Print</span>](http://citizen-statistician.org/2016/02/02/how-do-readers-perceive-the-results-of-a-data-analysis/#print \"Click to print\")\n-   -   \n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"fb-social-plugin fb-like\" data-font=\"lucida grande\"\ndata-ref=\"below-post\"\ndata-href=\"http://citizen-statistician.org/2016/02/02/how-do-readers-perceive-the-results-of-a-data-analysis/\"\ndata-width=\"450\">\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"fb-social-plugin fb-send\" data-font=\"lucida grande\"\ndata-ref=\"below-post\"\ndata-href=\"http://citizen-statistician.org/2016/02/02/how-do-readers-perceive-the-results-of-a-data-analysis/\">\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nThis entry was posted in\n[Musings](http://citizen-statistician.org/category/musings/) by\n[andy](http://citizen-statistician.org/author/andy/).
